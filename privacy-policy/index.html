We use this information to conduct internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our users. This information may include device information (e.g., your web browser type and language), the URL that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, access times, geolocation data, your IP address, pages viewed, details about how you’ve used the Site and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser. We may combine this information with information obtained from other sources such as our third-party service providers along with quotes we provide to you to personalize the services we provide and the experience you have when interacting with us.
                
            </p>
            <br><h4 class="py-2">Your Posts</h4>

            <br><h4 class="py-2">Your Communications & Correspondence</h4>
            <p>If you send us e-mails, letters or other personal correspondence (e.g., through the Site’s chat functionality), or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you or share them with third parties who provide services to us, such as web functionality. Communications with our customer service agents may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and to be able to better serve you.</p>
            <br><h4 class="py-2">Your Payment Information</h4>

            <br><h4 class="py-2">Cookies</h4>
            <p>We use cookies on certain pages of our Site. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your device to help websites and mobile apps remember things about you. Cookies can be used to track a user’s steps or automatically generate a user’s password. Some features of our Site may only be available through the use of a cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information to you which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. Most, but not all, cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although your use of the Site may then be restricted (as noted above). We use Google Analytics and other data collection tools (such as tracking pixels) to help us understand how the Site is used. If you would like to opt-out from the use of your information by Google analytics, you may use Google’s analytics opt-out browser add-on designed for this purpose.</p>
            <br><h4 class="py-2">How We Use Cookies</h4>
            <p>Like most providers of online services, Cayad uses cookies for a number of reasons, like protecting your data and account, helping us see which features are most popular, counting visitors to a page, improving our users’ experience, keeping our services secure, and just generally providing you with a better, more intuitive, and satisfying experience. The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.
            </p>

            <br><h4 class="py-2">Your Choices</h4>
            <p>Your browser or device may allow you to block or otherwise limit the use of cookies. But cookies are an important part of how our services work, so removing, rejecting, or limiting the use of them could affect the availability and functionality of our services.</p>
            <br><h4 class="py-2">Browser Cookies</h4>
            <p>Your browser may provide you with the option to refuse some or all browser cookies. You may also be able to remove cookies from your browser. For more information about how to manage browser cookies, please follow the instructions provided by your browser.</p>
            <br><h4 class="py-2">Mobile Device Identifiers</h4>
            <p>Your mobile operating system may let you opt-out from having certain device identifiers used for interest-based advertising. You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device’s manufacturer; this information is typically available under the “settings” function of your mobile device. If your mobile device offers an uninstall process, you can always stop us from collecting information through the app by uninstalling our app.</p>
